            <h6>Introduction</h6>
            <p>Thanks for using Raseet's products, services, websites, and apps which are branded as Raseet (Kryptonas Innovations Private Limited). These Terms of Use ("TOU") contain the terms under which Raseet and its affiliates provide their services to you and describe how the Services may be accessed and used. These TOU do not apply to Raseet Services which are available solely through our sales channel. Raseet provides a variety of different services. Additional service-specific terms and policies (including rules and guidelines) apply to some Services ("Additional Terms"). Those Additional Terms become a part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.
                <br> We refer to the combination of these TOU and any applicable Additional Terms collectively as these "Terms". You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using the Services. If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such a case, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization.
            </p>

            <h6>Description of Service</h6>
